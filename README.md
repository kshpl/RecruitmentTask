Hello,

Its example of my recruitment task. The idea of it was to create table that fetches dynamiclly data and displays them in table. Data comes from 2 diffrent APIs related together. ID of first is required to fetch incomes data from other one.

First click on header should sort table ascending,second should sort descending and third should restore default state.

Click on arrow buttons should increase or decrease index of datas in table, it should give an effect of paggination.

To check how this web application works, all You need to do is Download files/ Clone Repo and type in terminal 'npm install' to get all required files, then type 'npm start' to start.

/*27.12.19*/
Sorting does not work correctly and there is no filtering function implemented.
